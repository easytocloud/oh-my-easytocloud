# oh-my-easytocloud

oh-my-easytocloud is an oh-my-zsh theme to spice-up your command prompt.

It is 90% identical to agnoster, just some different collor scheme and support for AWS environments in your prompt.

AWS environments are part of [aws-profile-organizer](https://github.com/easytocloud/aws-profile-organizer)
