# oh-my-easytocloud

oh-my-easytocloud is an oh-my-zsh theme to spice-up your command prompt.

It is 90% identical to agnoster, just some different color scheme and support for AWS environments in your prompt.

AWS environments are part of [aws-profile-organizer](https://github.com/easytocloud/aws-profile-organizer)

Install the theme in the customs/themes directory of your oh-my-zsh installation (usually in ~/.oh-my-zsh).

```
cp themes/easytocloud.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes
```

and enjoy the new information in your prompt.

In the screenshot below you see the default profile is active in the training environment.
It also showcases our [privpage](https://github.com/easytocloud/privpage) aws cli integration to hide sensitive information in cli output!
